## Recommended Merge Order

Follow this sequence. **Do not merge out of order** — each step resolves a dependency for the next.

### Pre-merge: Split #5636 first

Before touching any PRs, execute the scope-creep split per [`docs/bba-memory-pr-5636-split-plan.md`](bba-memory-pr-5636-split-plan.md). This creates:
- `chore/extract-cdp-and-migration-idempotency` PR (new, fast review)
- Cleaned-up #5636 (force-pushed, ~200 line diff)

| Step | PR | Action | Estimated review time | Notes |
|------|-----|--------|----------------------|-------|
| 0 | Split extraction PR | Create + review + merge | 20 min | Straightforward; no BBA stack dependency |
| 1 | #5583 Phase A-D | Review + squash merge | 30 min | Foundation — SQLite schema, seeds, repo layer |
| 2 | #5595 Phase D-2/E-1 | Review + squash merge | 45 min | After #5583 merges; e2e tests + server routes |
| 3 | #5606 Test infra | Review + squash merge | 30 min | Can parallelize with #5601; needed before #5636 |
| 4 | #5601 Component 1 | Review + squash merge | 20 min | After #5595; UI read-only component |
| 5 | #5602 Component 2 | Review + squash merge | 45 min | HIGH RISK — execute bet. Needs careful review |
| 6 | #5604 Operator Playground | Review + squash merge | 20 min | After #5601 + #5602 |
| 7 | #5636 Phase F | Review + squash merge | 30 min | After split + #5602 + #5606 |
| 8 | TBD Phase F+ backend | Review + squash merge | 45 min | After #5636; Codex's rate-limit + metrics PR |
| 9 | #5641 Phase F+ UI | Review + squash merge | 20 min | After #5636 |
| 10 | Closure docs PR | Squash merge | 5 min | After #5641; docs only |

**Rationale for ordering**:
- #5583 before everything: BBA Memory SQLite schema must exist before any service code.
- #5606 before #5636: Phase F tests (when written) depend on the test-infra PR's `@testing-library/react` setup.
- #5602 before #5604: Playground embeds both C1 and C2 components.
- #5636 before Phase F+ PRs: Phase F+ branches are stacked on Phase F.
- Split extraction PR can merge at any time independently.

## Conflict-Risk Matrix

| PR pair | Risk | What conflicts | Mitigation |
|---------|------|----------------|-----------|
| #5601 + #5606 | Medium | `ui/src/components/bba-memory/` directory — both add files | Merge #5601 first; #5606 likely rebases cleanly |
| #5595 + #5636 | Low | `server/src/routes/betting-browser-automation.ts` — both touch route registration | #5595 merges first; #5636 will have minor rebase conflict on route registration line |
| #5636 + TBD backend | Medium | `server/src/routes/betting-browser-automation.ts` — rate-limiter middleware insertion point | Codex should rebase TBD after #5636 merges; review diff carefully before merge |
| #5641 + master drift | Low | `ui/src/api/bbaMemory.ts` — unlikely to be touched by unrelated master PRs | Rebase before merge if master has diverged >1 week |
| Any BBA PR + master merges | Low | `pnpm-lock.yaml` — frequent lockfile updates | Run `pnpm install` after rebase, add lockfile update to commit |

---

## Rollback Plan

Each PR merged via squash creates a single revertible commit. For any PR N that causes a production issue after merge:

```bash
# 1. Find the merge commit SHA
git log --oneline theproject1-glitch/master | grep "PR #N"

# 2. Create a revert branch
git checkout -b revert/bba-memory-pr-N origin/master
git revert <merge-commit-sha>
git push -u origin revert/bba-memory-pr-N

# 3. Open emergency PR
gh pr create --repo theproject1-glitch/paperclip \
  --base master \
  --title "revert(bba-memory): revert PR #N — <reason>" \
  --body "Emergency revert. Original PR: #N."

# 4. After merge, notify team and update bba-memory.md
```

**PR-specific rollback notes**:

| PR | Rollback complexity | Data migration concern |
|----|--------------------|-----------------------|
| #5583 | Low | SQLite DB created but can be deleted (`~/.paperclip/bba-memory/bba-memory.db`). No Postgres migration. |
| #5595 | Medium | Removes API routes; clients will 404. Acceptable brief outage. |
| #5601, #5602, #5604 | Low | UI-only; no data side-effects. |
| #5606 | Low | Test-only; no runtime impact. |
| #5636 | Medium | `idempotency_keys` table stays in SQLite after revert (schema not rolled back). Harmless orphan table. Route revert means no new keys written. |
| #5641 | Low | UI-only changes to `executeBbaBet` + `BbaMemoryExecuteBetPanel`. |

## Self-Merge Sequence

All 12 PRs merge into `theproject1-glitch:master`. Merge command for each:

```bash
gh pr merge <number> --repo theproject1-glitch/paperclip --squash --delete-branch
```

**Full sequence** (respect dependency order from Recommended Merge Order above):

| Step | PR | Self-merge ready? | Notes |
|------|-----|-------------------|-------|
| 0 | Split extraction PR (TBD) | ✅ When created | Deferred — see split plan |
| 1 | #5583 Phase A-D | ✅ Yes | Foundation |
| 2 | #5595 Phase D-2/E-1 | ✅ Yes | After #5583 |
| 3 | #5606 Test infra | ✅ Yes (BY DESIGN failures) | Merge despite red install checks; `refresh-lockfile` handles post-merge |
| 4 | #5601 Component 1 | ✅ Yes | After #5595 |
| 5 | #5602 Component 2 | ⚠️ Self-review required | HIGH RISK — real bet execution. Read risk callouts first. |
| 6 | #5604 Operator Playground | ✅ Yes | After #5601 + #5602 |
| 7 | #5636 Phase F | ⚠️ Self-review required | After split + #5602 + #5606; review idempotency route carefully |
| 8 | Codex PR #1 (backend-plus) | ⚠️ Self-review required | After #5636; rate-limiter + metrics endpoints |
| 9 | #5641 Phase F+ UI | ✅ Yes (after #5636) | Retarget to master after #5636 merges |
| 10 | #5642, #5643, #5645 | ✅ Yes | Docs only |
| 11 | This docs PR | ✅ Yes | Docs only |

After all PRs merged, tag production:

```bash
git checkout master && git pull origin master
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "BBA Memory vX.Y.Z — production release"
git push origin vX.Y.Z
# Then deploy from production branch or tag
```

## Pre-Merge Checklist per PR

Run before clicking Merge on each PR:

```bash
# 1. CI is green
gh pr checks <PR-number> --repo theproject1-glitch/paperclip

# 2. Branch is up to date with master
git fetch origin
git log origin/master..origin/<branch-name> --oneline  # should be empty after rebase

# 3. Diff makes sense (no accidental files)
gh pr diff <PR-number> --repo theproject1-glitch/paperclip | head -50

# 4. No pending review requests
gh pr view <PR-number> --repo theproject1-glitch/paperclip --json reviewRequests

# 5. For HIGH RISK PRs (#5602, #5636): confirm with Costel before merging
```

## Merge Window Recommendation

- Avoid merging on Friday afternoons or Saturday (no monitoring coverage).
- Merge #5583 → #5595 → #5606 → #5601 → #5602 in one session (order matters, ~3h).
- Allow 24h of production soak on #5602 before merging Phase F (#5636).
- Merge Phase F+ PRs (#5641, TBD backend) after Phase F has soaked 24h.
